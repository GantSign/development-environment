While it was always possible to use the development environment behind a proxy,
you had to know about the
[vagrant proxyconf plugin](https://github.com/tmatilai/vagrant-proxyconf); the
process wasn't part of the documentation and some post install manual setup was
still required to get Google Chrome to use the proxy.

This has now been addressed by updates to both the
[Getting Started]({{ '/docs/getting-started' | relative_url }}) documentation
and the [Configuration]({{ '/docs/configuration' | relative_url }})
documentation; the `vagrant-proxyconf` plugin is now auto-installed and the
GNOME proxy is configured as part of the provisioning; the proxy configuration
is part of the standard Nugrant configuration approach, so you can set the
default values in the `Vagrantfile` and users can override it in their
`.vagrantuser` files if necessary.
