Since GitKraken is no longer free for
[commercial use](https://blog.axosoft.com/2016/10/07/gitkraken-pricing-clarification/)
it's been replaced in the GantSign development environment.

Installed in place of GitKraken are Git-GUI and Gitk; while they're a lot less
pretty, they are more stable, feature complete and are open source.

For more details of Git-GUI and Gitk support view the
[features]({{ base_path }}/docs/features/#gitk) page.
