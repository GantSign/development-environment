While Node.js has been bundled with this development environment for the last
few months, it hasn't been a document feature.

After successfully using the Node.js support on a couple of projects it's time
to promote it as a documented feature.

For details of the Node.js support view the
[features]({{ base_path }}/docs/features/#for-nodejs-developers)
page.
