Getting your development environment setup correctly can be a time consuming and
error prone process; getting everyone on a team to setup their environment
correctly is even more challenging. The goal of this project is to make setting
up a development environment reliable and reproducible. This project provides a
generic development environment you can fork to add your project specific
configuration.
